# Make two DC motors move by Arduino.

As you can see in the file, the motors are connected to the diver, and the buttons are connected to the Arduino board. When we press the upper button, the upper motor will move, but when we press the lower button, the lower motor will move.


To build the circuit, I used:

- Arduino board.

- Two DC motors.

- Two buttons for the DC motors.

- L298 motor driver.
